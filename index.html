  everything i've seen says javascript includes belong in this position.
  for some reason i can't be bothered to find, they don't work in this position.
  i probably could find it, but this is already outside the scope of the lesson,
  and i'm not interested in poking around anymore.

  script include is instead at the end of the body, here line 54.

  was here because didn't like jumping around IDE and browser console, unclear
  relationship, unclear why some things worked and some things didn't, wanted
  to find out what the fuck was actually happening.
